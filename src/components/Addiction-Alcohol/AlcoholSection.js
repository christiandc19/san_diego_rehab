          <h1>Understanding Alcohol Addiction</h1>
              <p>Alcohol addiction, or alcoholism, is a chronic disease characterized by an uncontrollable urge to consume alcohol despite its negative impact on health, relationships, and daily functioning. It often involves physical dependence, where the body becomes accustomed to alcohol, leading to withdrawal symptoms when intake is reduced or stopped.</p>
              <h1>Causes of Alcohol Addiction</h1>
              <ul>
                <li>Genetic Factors: Genetics play a significant role in susceptibility to alcohol addiction. A family history of alcoholism can increase risk.</li>
                <li>Psychological Factors: Mental health conditions such as depression, anxiety, or trauma can contribute to alcohol misuse as individuals may use alcohol to self-medicate.</li>
                <li>Social Factors: Peer pressure, cultural norms, and stress from personal or professional life can influence drinking behaviors.</li>
                <li>Environmental Factors: Exposure to alcohol from a young age or living in environments where heavy drinking is normalized can increase risk.</li>
              </ul>

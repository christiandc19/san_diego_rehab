          <h1>What is MDMA?</h1>
              <p>MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine) is a synthetic drug that acts as both a stimulant and a hallucinogen. It alters mood and perception, creating feelings of increased energy, pleasure, emotional warmth, and distorted sensory and time perception. MDMA is commonly used in pill, capsule, or powder form and is often referred to by street names like Ecstasy, Molly, and E.</p>
              <h1>How MDMA Addiction Develops</h1>
              <p>MDMA addiction can develop when individuals repeatedly use the drug to achieve its pleasurable effects. The brain's reward system is altered, leading to compulsive drug-seeking behavior despite negative consequences. The cycle of addiction is fueled by the brain's increased release of serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine, which reinforce the desire to continue using MDMA.</p>
              <h1>Signs and Symptoms of MDMA Addiction</h1>
              <p>Recognizing the signs of MDMA addiction is crucial for early intervention. Common symptoms include:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>Increased tolerance to MDMA, requiring higher doses to achieve the same effects</li>
                <li>Cravings for MDMA</li>
                <li>Withdrawal symptoms such as depression, fatigue, and insomnia</li>
                <li>Neglecting responsibilities and activities once enjoyed</li>
                <li>Social isolation and changes in behavior</li>
                <li>Continued use despite negative physical, psychological, and social consequences</li>
              </ul>

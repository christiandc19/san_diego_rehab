          <h1>What Are Opioids?</h1>
              <p>Opioids are a class of drugs that include prescription pain relievers, such as oxycodone, hydrocodone, morphine, and fentanyl, as well as illegal drugs like heroin. These substances work by binding to opioid receptors in the brain and body, reducing pain and producing feelings of euphoria.</p>
              <h1>Causes of Opioid Addiction</h1>
              <ul>
                <li>Prescription Misuse: Many people become addicted to opioids after being prescribed these medications for pain. Misuse, such as taking higher doses or using someone else's prescription, can lead to addiction.</li>
                <li>Genetic Factors: Genetics play a significant role in addiction. Individuals with a family history of substance abuse are more likely to develop an addiction.</li>
                <li>Psychological Factors: Mental health disorders like depression, anxiety, and PTSD can increase the risk of opioid addiction. People may use opioids to self-medicate.</li>
                <li>Social Factors: Peer pressure, trauma, and environmental factors, such as easy access to opioids, also contribute to addiction.</li>
              </ul>

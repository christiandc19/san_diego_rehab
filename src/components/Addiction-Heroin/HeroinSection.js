          <h1>What is Heroin?</h1>
              <p>Heroin is an opioid drug made from morphine, a natural substance taken from the seed pod of the various opium poppy plants. It can be injected, snorted, or smoked. Heroin enters the brain rapidly and binds to opioid receptors on cells located in many areas, especially those involved in feelings of pain and pleasure and in controlling heart rate, sleeping, and breathing.</p>
              <h1>Causes and Risk Factors</h1>
              <p>The development of heroin addiction involves a combination of genetic, environmental, and psychological factors:</p>
              <ul>

                <li>Environmental Factors: Exposure to drug use in the home or community can influence initial drug use.</li>
                <li>Psychological Factors: Mental health disorders such as depression, anxiety, or PTSD can contribute to substance abuse as a form of self-medication.</li>
              </ul>

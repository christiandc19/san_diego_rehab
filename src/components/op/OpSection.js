            The least intensive program we provide, the outpatient program does not require overnight stays at our facilities. And although there is less time required for therapy sessions per week, we instill a high level of accountability for our patients in order for them to succeed in their journey to sobriety.
              <br /> <br />
              At San Diego Rehab, we recognize that overcoming addiction on your own may not be possible. Fortunately our treatment programs give you the path to healing/recovery. Through our outpatient program, we give you the tools to manage your addiction in the most healthy way possible. To learn more, reach out to us today.

              <h1 className="header">SOBER LIVING</h1>
              <br /> For many reasons, patients don’t always have a stable home-environment to return to after treatment. For these cases, we offer sober living homes in which patients can continue to strengthen themselves even further post-treatment.              <br /> <br />
              At our sober living homes, structure and accountability are at the patients’ side. The combination of our outpatient program with a transition to sober living communities boosts the success of our patients’ journey to sobriety.

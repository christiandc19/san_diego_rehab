          <h1>Symptoms of ADHD</h1>
          <p>ADHD symptoms are categorized into two main types: inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity. Some individuals may exhibit symptoms from both categories, which is known as combined presentation.</p>
          <p>Inattention Symptoms:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Difficulty sustaining attention in tasks or play activities
                </li>
                <li>Frequent careless mistakes in schoolwork or work tasks
                </li>
                <li>Avoidance of tasks requiring sustained mental effort
                </li>
                <li>Specific Phobias: These are intense, irrational fears of specific objects or situations, such as heights, animals, or flying. The fear is disproportionate to the actual danger posed, and individuals often go to great lengths to avoid the phobic trigger.
                </li>
                <li>Often losing things necessary for tasks and activities
                </li>
                <li>Easily distracted by extraneous stimuli
                </li>
                <li>Forgetfulness in daily activities</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Hyperactivity/Impulsivity Symptoms:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Fidgeting or tapping hands and feet</li>
                <li>Difficulty remaining seated in situations where expected</li>
                <li>Running or climbing in inappropriate situations</li>
                <li>Inability to play or engage in activities quietly</li>
                <li>Excessive talking</li>
                <li>Interrupting or intruding on othersâ€™ conversations or games</li>
                <li>Difficulty waiting for their turn</li>
              </ul>

              <h1>Causes and Risk Factors</h1>
              <p>The exact cause of ADHD is not fully understood, but research suggests a combination of genetic, environmental, and neurological factors. Risk factors may include:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Genetics: ADHD tends to run in families.</li>
                <li>Brain Structure and Function: Differences in brain activity and structure, particularly in areas related to attention and self-control.</li>
                <li>Premature Birth: Children born prematurely or with low birth weight may have a higher risk.</li>
                <li>Environmental Exposure: Exposure to toxins, such as lead, and prenatal exposure to alcohol or tobacco smoke.</li>
              </ul>

              <h1>Diagnosis and Treatment</h1>
              <p>Diagnosing ADHD involves a comprehensive evaluation by a healthcare professional, including a clinical interview, behavior rating scales, and often input from teachers or caregivers. It is crucial to rule out other conditions that may mimic ADHD symptoms.</p>
              <p>Treatment Approaches:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Medication: Stimulant medications, such as methylphenidate and amphetamines, are commonly prescribed. Non-stimulant medications are also available.
                </li>
                <li>Behavioral Therapy: Includes strategies for managing behavior, organizational skills, and social interactions.
                </li>
                <li>Lifestyle Changes: Regular physical activity, a balanced diet, and adequate sleep can help manage symptoms.
                </li>
              </ul>

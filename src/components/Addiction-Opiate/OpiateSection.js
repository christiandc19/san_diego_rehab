          <h1>What Are Opiates?</h1>
              <p>Opiates are a class of drugs naturally derived from the opium poppy plant. They are primarily used for pain relief and include drugs such as morphine, codeine, and thebaine. Opioids, which include synthetic and semi-synthetic substances like oxycodone, hydrocodone, and fentanyl, are often grouped with opiates. Both opiates and opioids interact with the brain's opioid receptors to reduce pain and induce euphoria, making them highly addictive.</p>
